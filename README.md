I try my best to create elegant solutions to complex problems, though more often than not, I find myself building elementary solutions to problems that have already been solved by someone smarter than me.

### 🛠️ What I'm Working On
- 📚 Learning more about network programming through [Protohackers](https://protohackers.com/) challenges and [Network Programming with Go by Adam Woodbeck](https://www.amazon.com/Network-Programming-Go-Adam-Woodbeck/dp/1718500882)
### 🗃️ Recent Projects
- 📦 [go-fs](https://github.com/portbound/go-fs) building my own file storage solution to save a couple bucks by canceling my Dropbox subscription
- 🌐 [TCP -> HTTP](https://github.com/portbound/tcp-to-http) a primitive implementation of TCP -> HTTP/1.1 from scratch with the Go stdlib. I plan on revisiting this to see if I can improve my implementation after I feel more competent with networking.

### 💭 What I'm Into
- ⌨️ Neovim
- 🏋️ Picking up heavy things and putting them back down
