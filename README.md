I enjoy the challenge of creating elegant solutions to complex problems—

though more often than not, I find myself building acceptable solutions to problems that have already been solved by someone smarter than me.

**Software is my one true passion**

- 🧮 Practicing DSA
- 🦙 Building [Gollama](https://github.com/portbound/go-llama) a terminal-based REPL chat app for Ollama using [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)
