I try my best to create elegant solutions to complex problems, though more often than not, I find myself building primitive solutions to problems that have already been solved by someone smarter than me.

### 🛠️ What I'm Working On
- 📚 Learning Go
- 📚 Learning more about network programming through [Protohackers](https://protohackers.com/) challenges
### 🗃️ Recent Projects
- 📦 [go-fs](https://github.com/portbound/go-fs) building my own file storage solution to save a couple bucks by canceling my Dropbox subscription
- 🌐 [TCP -> HTTP](https://github.com/portbound/tcp-to-http) a primitive implementation of TCP -> HTTP/1.1 from scratch with the Go stdlib
