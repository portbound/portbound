I try my best to create elegant solutions to complex problems, though more often than not, I find myself building elementary solutions to problems that have already been solved by someone smarter than me.

### 🛠️ What I'm Working On
- Learning more about network programming through [Protohackers](https://protohackers.com/) challenges and [Network Programming with Go by Adam Woodbeck](https://www.amazon.com/Network-Programming-Go-Adam-Woodbeck/dp/1718500882)

### 🗃️ Recent Side Projects
- [bitcask](https://github.com/portbound/bitcask) implementing bitcask from the original spec as outlined [here](https://riak.com/assets/bitcask-intro.pdf). 
- [go-fs](https://github.com/portbound/go-fs) building my own file storage solution to save a couple bucks by canceling my Dropbox subscription.

### 💭 What I'm Into
- ⌨️ Neovim
- 🏋️ Picking up heavy things and putting them back down
