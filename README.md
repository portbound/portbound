I enjoy creating elegant solutions to complex problems—

but more often than not, I'm crafting *mediocre* solutions to problems that have already been solved by someone smarter than me.

**Software is my one true passion**

### 🛠️ What I'm Working On

- 🧠 Learning Go and Neovim 
- 🦙 Building [Gollama](https://github.com/portbound/go-llama) a terminal-based REPL chat app for Ollama using [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)
